# CSS Organization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the CSS organization work completed for the OPER website. All inline styles have been externalized and common styles have been consolidated into shared CSS files.

## Files Modified

### HTML Files
1. **index.html** - Homepage
2. **quemsomos.html** - About page
3. **recursos.html** - Resources page
4. **tour-guiado.html** - Guided tour page

### New CSS Files Created
1. **css/index-inline-styles.css** - Contains styles that were previously inline in index.html
2. **css/quemsomos-inline-styles.css** - Contains styles that were previously inline in quemsomos.html
3. **css/recursos-inline-styles.css** - Contains styles that were previously inline in recursos.html
4. **css/tour-inline-styles.css** - Contains styles that were previously inline in tour-guiado.html
5. **css/common-styles.css** - Contains common styles used across multiple pages

## Changes Made

### 1. Externalized Inline Styles
All inline styles from the HTML files have been moved to external CSS files:
- `<style>` blocks removed from HTML files
- Styles moved to appropriately named CSS files
- HTML files updated to link to the new CSS files

### 2. Common Style Consolidation
Common styles used across multiple pages have been consolidated into `css/common-styles.css`:
- CTA row styles (`.cta-row`)
- CTA separator styles (`.cta-separator`)
- Tour button styles (`.tour-button`)
- Responsive styles for mobile and desktop

### 3. File Structure Improvements
- All CSS files are now properly organized in the `css/` directory
- HTML files link to CSS files using relative paths
- Common styles are shared across pages to reduce redundancy

## Benefits
1. **Maintainability** - Styles are now in separate files, making them easier to maintain
2. **Performance** - Common styles are consolidated, reducing overall file size
3. **Consistency** - Shared styles ensure consistent appearance across pages
4. **Caching** - External CSS files can be cached by browsers for better performance
5. **Separation of Concerns** - HTML structure is separated from styling

## Testing
All pages have been tested to ensure:
- Proper rendering on desktop and mobile devices
- Responsive design works correctly
- No broken links to CSS files
- All visual elements appear as expected

## Next Steps
1. Consider further optimization of CSS files to reduce redundancy
2. Implement CSS minification for production deployment
3. Consider using a CSS preprocessor like Sass for better organization
4. Add documentation for the CSS class naming conventions
