Even with all dedication and care, that doubt always arises: are tasks being done at the right time? Is nothing being forgotten?
Yes, we are human. And to mitigate failures and reduce concerns, applying the Criticality Level concept can ensure more peaceful nights and greater control over your operation — whether in hotels, condominiums, schools, fleets, corporate buildings, or industrial operations.

Why Criticality Level is essential
Organizing maintenance tasks by criticality level brings benefits that impact the entire operation:
Operational predictability: you know exactly what needs to be done and when.
Risk reduction: avoids fines, accidents, and legal problems.
Asset protection: equipment and infrastructure last longer and work better.
Satisfaction and confidence: customers, users, or collaborators perceive that everything is under control.
It doesn't matter the type of operation: hotels, fleets, schools, or industries all benefit from the same methodology.
